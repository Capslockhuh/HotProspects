# HotProspects

Project 16 of the 100 days of SwiftUI course: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

A demo of an app to be used at conferences. Every person has their own QR Code generated from their name and email address. They can scan other people's codes so they get added to their list in the app. You can track which people you've already contacted and which would you like to contact. There are also features like scheduling a notification to contact someone, or changing how your list should be sorted.
Thanks to Paul Hudson for providing the free QR Code scanner Swift package. You can download it at: https://github.com/twostraws/SamplePackage
